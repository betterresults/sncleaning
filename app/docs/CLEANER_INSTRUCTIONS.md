## 📸 How to Use the App

### Uploading Photos for Bookings

This is the main feature that makes the app better than the website:

1. **Open the app** and log in
2. **Go to your bookings** (Bookings tab)
3. **Select a booking** that needs photos
4. **Tap "Upload Photos"** button
5. **Select photo type:**
   - Before Photos
   - After Photos
   - During Photos
6. **Choose multiple photos at once:**
   - Your phone's native photo picker will open
   - Select as many photos as you need
   - Tap **Done** or **Select**
7. **Photos upload automatically:**
   - You'll see upload progress for each photo
   - Photos are uploaded in batches (5 at a time)
   - You can see which photos succeeded or failed
8. **Stay on the screen** until all photos finish uploading

### Tips for Best Results

✅ **Use WiFi when possible** - Uploading many photos uses data  
✅ **Keep the app open** - Don't switch apps while uploading  
✅ **Check the progress** - Make sure all photos show "✓ Uploaded"  
✅ **Retry failed uploads** - If a photo fails, you can try again

## 📱 Website vs Native App

### The Native App (This App):
✅ **Better photo selection** - Select multiple photos at once easily  
✅ **More reliable uploads** - Uploads work better on all Android phones  
✅ **Native camera integration** - Smooth camera experience  
✅ **Offline support** - App loads even without internet  

### The Website (Also Still Works!):
- You can still use the website at your normal URL
- Useful as a backup if the app has issues
- All data syncs between app and website

**You can use either one!** But the app is recommended for photo uploads.
