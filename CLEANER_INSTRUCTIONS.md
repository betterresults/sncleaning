## Why Native App vs Website?

The website (PWA) works well, but some Android phones struggle with:
- Selecting many photos at once
- Camera permissions
- Memory management with large files

The native app solves these issues by using Android's built-in file picker and better memory handling.

**If you prefer the website**, you can still use it! Just open your browser and go to the normal website URL. Both work!

## Security & Privacy

- ✅ Photos upload to the **same servers** as the website
- ✅ Only **authorized staff** can see your bookings
- ✅ The app does **not track your location** or personal activity
- ✅ This app is **built by your company**, not a third party
